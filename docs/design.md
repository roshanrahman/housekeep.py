# Motivation 

- Have too much crap in my Downloads folder I don't need, like archives and installers. 

- Offload the manual work of deleting items immediately after using them, i.e. after extraction, installation. 

- Keep things organized. Perform deletion and backups based on conditions. 

For example: 

- If files in this folder haven't been accessed for 15 days, delete them.
 
- Check periodically a folder. If files in this folder have been modified, make a backup.
